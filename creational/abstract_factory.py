"""
What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that
provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent
objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is all about encapsulating
the object creation process and ensuring that the created objects are compatible.

Solving a Common Problem
Before we dive into the intricacies of the Abstract Factory pattern,
letâ€™s set the stage. Imagine you are designing an intricate software system,
and you need to create multiple related objects, such as a GUI library
for cross-platform applications, a database abstraction layer, or in our case
a multi-channel notification service (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).
As the system evolves, you may need to switch between different families of
objects without altering existing code. This is where the Abstract Factory pattern shines.
