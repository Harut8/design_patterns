PROBLEM 


Problem
Imagine that your team develops an app which works with
geographic information structured as one colossal graph.
Each node of the graph may represent a complex entity such as a city,
but also more granular things like industries, sightseeing areas, etc.
The nodes are connected with others if thereâ€™s a road between the real
objects that they represent. Under the hood, each node type is represented by
its own class, while each specific node is an object.
